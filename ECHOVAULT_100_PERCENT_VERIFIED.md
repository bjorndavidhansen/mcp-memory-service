## 🎯 **Architecture Status**

### **✅ EchoVault Storage Flow (100% Working)**
```
Memory Input → EchoVault Storage
    ├── Generate Embeddings (SentenceTransformer) ✅ WORKING
    ├── Store in Neon PostgreSQL (pgvector) ✅ WORKING  
    ├── Store in Qdrant Cloud (vector search) ✅ WORKING
    └── Store large content in R2 (blob storage) ✅ WORKING
```

### **✅ Service Integration Status**
- **Neon PostgreSQL:** ✅ Connected with pgvector, 384D vectors
- **Qdrant Cloud:** ✅ Working with 384D vectors, auto-recreation when needed
- **R2 Blob Storage:** ✅ Connected (bucket: echovault-events)
- **Embedding Model:** ✅ Generating 384-dim vectors
- **MCP Server:** ✅ Running with EchoVault mode

---

## 🔧 **Key Fixes Applied for 100% Status**

### **Critical Issues Resolved:**
1. **✅ Vector Dimension Consistency** - Fixed 1536D→384D mismatch
2. **✅ Timestamp Format** - Fixed ISO→Unix conversion for Neon
3. **✅ Embedding Model** - SentenceTransformer initialization working
4. **✅ Prometheus Metrics** - Fixed method calls, disabled when endpoints invalid
5. **✅ R2 Authentication** - Raw secret key (no SHA-256 hashing)
6. **✅ Qdrant ID Format** - String→Integer conversion for compatibility
7. **✅ pgvector Format** - List→String conversion with ::vector casting

### **Performance Optimizations:**
- Consistent 384D vector dimensions across all services
- Automatic collection recreation when dimension mismatches detected
- Graceful fallback when services temporarily unavailable
- Clean telemetry operation without noise
